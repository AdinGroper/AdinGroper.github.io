        </div>

        <div class="dest-intro">
            <p> Niagara Falls is a city in Canada that lies along the border between the USA and Canada.
                It shares a name with Niagara Falls, New York, which is situated on the opposite side of
                the Niagara River. Both cities are named after the immense waterfalls that flow over into
                the gorge below. The Niagara River connects Lake Erie to the lower-lying Lake Ontario.

            <p> Seeing Niagara Falls at some point in my life was high up on my bucket list, so when my dad
                and I saw cheap flights to Buffalo, NY, we pounced. Immediately after arriving in Buffalo, we
                drove the short distance up to Niagara Falls, NY, where we stayed for the majority of the trip.

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> We spent the first full day at the falls on the American side, starting the day with the famous
                Maid of the Mist boat tour. 10/10 experience even though I was blinded by the water droplets on
                my glasses for half the ride. I also found it quite cool how all the ponchos on the American side
                were blue while all the ponchos on the Canadian Hornblower were red; it created a nice duality
                between the two countries.

            <p> We spent the rest of that day exploring other points of interest in the region. Nearest to the
                falls was the site of the Schoellkopf power plant that was destroyed by a rockslide in the 1950s.
                Further down the river was the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, which serves as the current 
                hydroelectric plant for the American side, which provides electricity to a large portion of the 
                state of New York. The journey north ended at Fort Niagara, which sits on Lake Ontario. Although 
                we didn't go inside fort, I did get my picture taken next to a cool stone lighthouse.

            <p> That night, we hurriedly made our way back to the viewing platform over the gorge to catch the 
                nightly firework show at 10pm and see the lights illuminating the falls in a variety of colors.

            <p> The second day of the trip, we ventured across the Rainbow Bridge into the Canadian side of the
                falls. Crossing the border on foot was quite a cool experience, so I had to post up next to the
                international boundary line along the bridge.

            <p> Once across, we began walking along the river bank and I could not stop taking pictures of the falls.
                The views from the Canadian side were truly immaculate. From the Canadian side, you could see the 
                American and Bridal Veil Falls in full effect, and could get much closer to the Horseshoe Falls than 
                you can on the American side. We eventually stopped for a quick lunch at the famous Tim Hortons before
                meeting up with our tour guide for the afternoon.

            <p> We started the walking tour off with views from the top of Skylon Tower, a 775 ft observation tower
                that overlooked the falls and surrounding areas. Along the tour, we were given the history of the
                falls, some geographical context, and how modern day Canada capitalizes on its hydroelectric potential
                with their power plant systems.

            <p> After leaving the tower, we headed toward the Niagara Parks Power Station, which was the first major
                power plant used by Canada and now serves as an educational and interactive museum. Once inside, we
                took a long elevator ride down to the bottom of the gorge, following the path that water once took from
                river upstream, down through the penstock and turbines, and eventually back out through tunnels that
                fed into the river downstream. At the bottom of the elevator, we got to walk through one of the long 
                tailrace tunnels that led out to an up-close view behind the falls.

            <p> After resurfacing, we spent another hour or so exploring the museum, learning about the history of the
                technology used in the plant, and even getting to watch a demonstration that used a large Tesla coil to
                create music from high-voltage discharges of electricity. Upon exiting the museum, I got to see some of 
                the infamous Canada geese (and accidentally stepped in their... droppings), and then took one final photo
                before heading back toward the border.

            <p> As we began walking back toward the Rainbow Bridge to end the day, we were suddenly met with a huge, 
                full-sized rainbow that stretched out across the falls. Genuinely one of the coolest natural phenomenon
                I've had the pleasure to experience. It certainly made for a great ending.
